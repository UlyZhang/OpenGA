# OpenGA
This OpenGA aims at solving different kinds of problems, including continuous, discrete, or sequencing problems. In addition, these problems may accompany with multiple objective problems. OpenGA is able to solve them because this library adopts many evolutionary strategies.

### Usage
Continuous problem:
```
$ java -classpath .; src/openga.applications.Himmelblau

```
$ java -classpath .; src/openga.applications.mTSPSGA
```

Parallel machine problem:
```
$ java -classpath .; src/openga.applications.ParallelMachine
```
